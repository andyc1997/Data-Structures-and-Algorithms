# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Starting from March 2020, I have been learning algorithms in a more formal way through this specialization offered in Coursera, and try to solve algorithmic problems using Python. Explanations are provided in code. Every task is done in Python3, and I try to complete all tasks in this specialization.
